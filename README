Who uses this software? :)

I have implemented the Big Integer Calculator by using string class.
So, This software doesn't have a limit of digit number.

ex) We can calculate 1000! (factorial).

But I think calculation speed may be slow compare with another software.

Please see main.cpp and you can find some examples.

Thanks to see my poor software. :)
