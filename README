I have implemented the Big Integer Calculator by using string class.
So, This software doesn't has restriction of number of digit.

ex) We can calculate 1000! (factorial).

But calculation speed may be slow compare with another software.

Please see main.cpp and you can find some examples.

Thanks to see my software. :)
